#smop. 
Welcome to smop.! Below is some info on what I plan on using:

##Lang/lib:
* html
* css
* js
* python (maybe)
* node
* express (no pug, but see below on how to make a page)
* bootstrap
* jquery
* mongodb
* mongoose
* jsonwebtoken
* nodemon

##General Etiquette (applicable on /all/ files
* Use Beautify.io to get the right styling. I use Brackets which has a plugin for it

##Some Helpful Resources

* https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/

##html/Pug Etiquette (aka how to make a page)
* html and Pug files are located in the views folder
* html files are included in Jade files
* Pug files are processed into client facing files (eg - if I wanted a page called user.html, it would be called user.pug in the views folder and have 2+ lines of code, all of which are includes to html files *see index.pug for example*
* **header.html *must* be included in all Pug files**
* **only html files may be included in Pug files**
* Each page's html file must close the header before beginning a body
* headers should not include anything that can be seen by the user

##JS Etiquette
* **no javascripts in html documents,** *they belong in .js documents in the /public/javascripts folder and are to be linked via* \<script src="/public/javascripts/mysource.js">\</script>

##API Etiquette 
* **never call localhost:3001/api/... from outside of api**, make a function in the API to do so
